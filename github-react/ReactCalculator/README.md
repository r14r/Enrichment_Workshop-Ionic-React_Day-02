A React Native tutorial where you'll write a calculator app for Android and iOS.

The tutorial is broken up into three parts:

1. [Part 1](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-1-hello-react) of the tutorial will demonstrate project setup, writing a traditional “Hello World” application, and organizing the code prior to heading into Part 2.
2. In [Part 2](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-2-designing-a-calculator), I’ll be guiding you through the process of designing a calculator app that runs on both platforms, using the latest and greatest that React Native has to offer. The goal is to get you up to speed on the basics of React Native, including flexbox and style sheets, and to give you a starting point from which we can continue to actually develop the calculator’s functionality.
3. In [Part 3](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-3-developing-a-calculator), we’ll develop the actual calculator implementation, including listening to touch events, performing the arithmetic, and updating the UI using React Native’s state.
